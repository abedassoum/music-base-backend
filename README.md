## Introduction

The Music Artist Showcase project is a web application built using Node.js, Express, and MySQL on the backend, and vanilla JavaScript and CSS on the frontend. It provides a platform for showcasing music artists and their songs/albums, making it easy for music enthusiasts to discover new music and artists. This README will guide you through setting up, configuring, and deploying the project.

## Features

- Browse and search for music artists.
- View artist profiles with details about their albums and songs.
- Listen to sample tracks of songs.
- Admin panel for adding, editing, or deleting artists, albums, and songs.
- User-friendly and responsive design for seamless use on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system for storing artist, album, and song data.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: The core JavaScript language used for frontend interactivity.
- **CSS**: Styling the frontend for an engaging user experience.
- **Azure**: Cloud hosting platform used for deploying the backend of the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MySQL (v5.7 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-artist-showcase.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd music-artist-showcase
   ```

3. Install the backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. Install the frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database and execute the SQL script provided in `database.sql` to set up the required tables and initial data.

2. Update the database configuration in `backend/config/db.config.js` with your MySQL database credentials.

### Backend Configuration

1. In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example` file.

2. Update the `.env` file with your configuration settings, including Azure connection details, JWT secret key, and any other environment variables needed.

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Configuration

1. In the `frontend` directory, create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example` file.

2. Update the `.env` file with the backend API URL (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api`).

3. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

To deploy the project on Azure or any other hosting service, you'll need to configure your server environment, set up the database, and ensure the frontend communicates with the backend using the appropriate API URL. Consult the documentation of your hosting service for specific deployment instructions.
